In order to deal with computationally complex problems,
divide and conquer strategies are sometimes successful.
Here we focus on the applicability of net structure theory to the decomposition phase.
A taxonomy using two criteria allows to situate many performance evaluation
techniques in the literature.
The solution or composition phase may employ techniques as different as Kronecker
algebra, response time approximation or bottleneck analysis."

  ANNOTE="Net-driven decomposition techniques are considered in this paper
in order to reduce the state explosion problem for the computation
of performance indices of stochastic Petri nets.
Basically, the idea is to represent (or partially represent)
in a decomposed manner the reachability graph of the model
so it can be used for exact and/or approximated performance analysis.
In that way, the complete storing of the graph is avoided and, for the case
of approximate analysis, the solution of the isomorphous continuous
time Markov chain is substituted by the solution of smaller components.
The techniques are applied to a couple of non-trivial models."}

  TITLE="Structured Solution of Asynchronously Communicating Stochastic Modules",
  JOURNAL="IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering",
  VOLUME=25,
  NUMBER=2,
  PAGES="147-165",
  MONTH="March",
  YEAR=1999 ,
  ANNOTE="Asynchronously Communicating Stochastic Modules (SAM) are Petri nets
that can be seen as a set of modules that communicate through buffers,
so they are not (yet another) Petri net subclass, but they complement
a net with a structured view.
This paper considers the problem of exploiting the
compositionality of the view to generate the state space and
to find the steady-state probabilities of a stochastic extension
of SAM in a net-driven, efficient way.
Essentially, we give an expression of an auxiliary matrix, G,
which is a supermatrix of the infinitesimal generator of a SAM.
G is a tensor algebra [Davio 1981] expression of matrices of the
size of the components for which it is possible to numerically solve the
characteristic steady-state solution equation pi.G = 0,
without the need to explicitly compute G.
Therefore, we obtain a method that computes the steady-state solution of a
SAM without ever explicitly computing and storing its infinitesimal generator,
and therefore without computing and storing the reachability graph of the system.

  abstract = {Over the last decade, the relevance of performance evaluation in the early stages of
             the software development life-cycle has been steadily rising. We honestly believe that
             the integration of formal models in the software engineering process is a must, in
             order to enable the application of well-known, powerful analysis techniques to
             software models. In previous papers the authors have stated a proposal for SPE,
             dealing with several UML diagram types.The proposal formalizes their semantics, and
             provides a method to translate them into (analyzable) GSPN models. This paper focuses
             on activity diagrams, which had not been dealt with so far. They will be incorporated
             in our SPE method, enhancing its expressivity by refining abstraction levels in the
             statechart diagrams. Performance requirements will be annotated according to the UML
             profile for schedulability, performance and time. Last but not least, our CASE tool
             prototype will be introduced. This tool deals with every model element from activity
             diagrams and ensures an automatic translation from ADs into GSPNs strictly following
             the process related in this paper.},

                uses the UML diagrams to specify the functional and performance requeriments of the
                system and the stochastic Petri nets formalism to analyse it.},

             networks; the reason is the inadequate use of the net resources that they need. If
             these kind of systems are designed using mobile agent technology the previous problem
             might be avoided. In this paper, we present a comparison between the performance of a
             software retrieval system especially designed to be used in a wireless network and the
             performance of a software retrieval system similar to the well-known Tucows.com web
             site. In order to compare performance, we make use of a software performance process
             enriched with formal techniques. The process has as important features that it uses
             UML as a design notation and it uses stochastic Petri nets as formal model. Petri nets
             provide a formal semantics for the system and a performance model.},

             intention to close both fields, software engineering and performance analysis.
             Nevertheless the gap remains, since it is difficult for software engineers to devise
             which parts of their designs are suitable to represent performance requirements. The
             profile has started to study this problem from a scenarios viewpoint. In this work, we

             scepticism halo. There are researchers who question its utility because it could be a
             new technology that does provide new skills but it could introduce new problems.
             Security and performance are the most critical aspects for this new kind of software.
             In this paper we present a formal approach to analyse performance for this class of
             systems, which is integrated in the early stages of the software development process.
             We propose to model the software system in a pragmatic way using as a design technique
             the well-known design patterns; from these models, the corresponding formal
             performance model, in terms of Petri nets, is obtained semi-automatically by applying
             a set of translation rules. Therefore, the formal performance model is obtained as a
             by-product of the software life-cycle, preserving the benefits of the software design
             techniques. Finally, the formal performance model is analysed, using analytical
             techniques, in order to study the performance of the system. Moreover, another benefit
             of the proposal is that it is possible to predict the behaviour of the system without
             the necessity of implementing it. To illustrate the proposal, we apply it to a
             software retrieval service system designed using mobile agents.},
